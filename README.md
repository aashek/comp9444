# Hand Gesture Recognition
COMP9444 group project on hand gesture recognition.


## Getting the dataset
Dowload the raw dataset from Medeley [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jzy8zngkbg/4).
#### On mac:
```
brew install unar
```
```
unar HGM-4.rar
```

## Setting up jupyter notebooks
Up to you, but I decided to use a virtual environment to install jupyter notebooks. `cd` into `galaxy-gesture` directory and run:
```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install jupyter
```
Then to open jupyter notebook in your browser run:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Git setup
A guide on setting up your own UNIX-based machine to use git is available
[here](git_setup.md).
